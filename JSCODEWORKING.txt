📣 Demystifying JavaScript Execution: An Easy-to-Understand GitHub Update 🚀

Hey fellow coders! Ever been curious about the magic behind JavaScript execution? Let's dive in and spruce up our GitHub knowledge hub!

🔄 Embarking on the Code Execution Journey:
JavaScript guides your code through a well-thought-out process. Picture it like a script unfolding line by line in a dynamic and somewhat unpredictable dance, all thanks to the Call Stack.

🌐 Exploring the Global Code Execution Context:
Inside the stack, the star of the show is the Global Code Execution Context, strutting through two key phases - PHASE-1 (Memory/Variable Environment) and PHASE-2 (Code/Thread of Execution).

PHASE-1 (Memory/Variable Environment):

Variables get their memory space, initially tagged as 'undefined.'
Functions find a cozy spot in memory, holding onto their entire code for future use.
PHASE-2 (Code/Thread of Execution):

Values settle into their designated memory slots.
Functions, when encountered, patiently wait for their turn in the execution queue.
Function calls kick off secondary execution contexts, following the familiar PHASE-1 & PHASE-2 routine.
🔄 Witnessing Recursion in Action:
The execution dance continues as secondary contexts navigate through memory allocation and code execution. Keep an eye on return statements; they're the messengers sending back calculated values to the global execution context.

🗑️ Post-Function Cleanup:
After the function party, the secondary context bids farewell, letting the global execution context carry on its journey. Once the entire code takes a bow, the global context gracefully exits, leaving the call stack spotless.
